# Analysis of School District Data

## Overview of the school district analysis
The school board has some reservations concerning the academic dishonesty regarding the math and reading score of 
the ninth graders at Thomas High School and notified Maria and her supervisor to send a new report omitting these scores. 
The task is to run a new report where the math and reading scores are for ninth graders at "Thomas High School" and see
how the results differ. To do so, "NaNs" will be replacing theses said scores for both math and reading for said school; 
and a new report will be generated showing the distrcit summary, the school summary, the top and bottom 5 schools 
based on overall passing rate of math and reading results, the average reading score for each grade level and the scores 
by school spending per student, by school size and school type.

## Summary
The school district analysis shows:

-The ommision of the ninth graders' math and reading scores of Thomas High Scholl (THS has no real impact on the overall 
passing rate of the schools in the district. Counting the THS nith graders scores, and without it, the passing rate went from 
65% to 64.9% which is not much significant. 

-The ommision of the scores did not really affect THS's overall passing rate significantly. THS went from 91% passing rate
to a 90.6 % which is about .04% difference. THS is still a top 5 school andthe second best school in the distrcit. 

-The ommission does not really change the math and reading score by grade. It only does not yield a score
for the ninth graders for THS. It only affects the math passing rate spending range for the $630-$644 range where it went form 73% before 
to 67% after ommission. Only the medium school size is affected by the change as it went from 94% to 88% of the  math passing rate. The ath passing rate 
of the charter school also decreased from 94% to 90% after the change. 

  
  
  ## Challenge Summary
  After changing the math and reading schores of Thomas High School to NaNs, these scores have been ommitted basically. This change did not have significant 
  in the overall passing rate of the district and school as THS was still #2 overall. The only thing that reallly changed was the chool size, spending and type of 
  school of the passing math rate. The ommision decreased the math, reading and overall passsing rate of THS a little but not signinficant enough. This could be
  due to the fact that THS doe not have many nith graders, or the 10th-12th graders did so well that the ninth graders scores were insignificant.
